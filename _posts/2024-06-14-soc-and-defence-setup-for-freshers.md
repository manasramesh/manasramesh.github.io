# Beginner-Friendly SOC Architecture on AWS ‚Äî A Learning-Focused Prototype

Are you a student or security enthusiast looking to understand how a Security Operations Center (SOC) architecture works? This deep dive introduces a **learning-focused, cost-conscious SOC prototype** built on AWS using open-source tools. It's designed to help beginners grasp core security concepts, defense-in-depth principles, and incident response workflows.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Disclaimer**: This is a **learning prototype**, not a production-ready or industry-standard architecture. It's specifically designed for beginners to understand SOC concepts in a cost-effective way. Do not use this design for production environments without significant security hardening and professional review.

> üîç **Learning Goal**: This setup helps you understand how different security layers work together, how logs flow through a SOC, and how automated responses can be implemented. Feel free to modify, simplify, or enhance based on your learning objectives and budget.

## üåê Architecture Overview

![AWS SOC Architecture Diagram](/assets/img/aws-soc-architecture.png)
*Beginner-Friendly SOC Architecture for Learning Defense-in-Depth Concepts*

This architecture demonstrates **defense-in-depth** principles with multiple security layers:

- **Perimeter Defense**: First line of defense against external threats
- **Application Security**: Web-layer protection and filtering
- **Host Monitoring**: Endpoint detection and system monitoring
- **Centralized Logging**: Log aggregation and correlation
- **Automated Response**: Basic incident response automation
- **Cloud Security**: AWS-native monitoring and alerting

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components Explained

### 1. **Network Foundation - AWS VPC Setup**

#### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Your VPC acts as your isolated network environment in AWS. Think of it as your own private data center in the cloud where you control all network traffic.

#### Subnets Strategy
- **Public Subnet**: Contains internet-facing components that need direct internet access
- **Private Subnet**: Houses your applications and sensitive systems, protected from direct internet access

#### Why This Separation Matters
This subnet separation is a fundamental security principle. Your applications don't need direct internet access - they can receive traffic through controlled entry points (like load balancers or reverse proxies) while remaining protected in private subnets.

### 2. **Perimeter Defense Layer**

#### Option A: pfSense + Suricata (Open Source Approach)
- **pfSense**: Acts as your network firewall and gateway
- **Suricata**: Provides intrusion detection and prevention capabilities
- **Deployment**: Single EC2 instance running both services
- **Learning Value**: Understand how network-level filtering works

#### Option B: AWS WAF + Application Load Balancer (Managed Approach)
- **AWS WAF**: Managed web application firewall service
- **ALB**: Distributes incoming traffic and provides SSL termination
- **Learning Value**: Experience with cloud-native security services

**Why Two Options?** This shows you can achieve similar security goals using either open-source tools (more control, more management) or managed services (less control, less management overhead).

### 3. **Application Layer Protection**

#### NGINX Reverse Proxy + ModSecurity
- **Purpose**: Acts as an intermediary between external traffic and your application
- **ModSecurity**: Adds web application firewall capabilities
- **Learning Value**: Understand how application-layer filtering works
- **Placement**: In the private subnet, receiving traffic only from your perimeter defense

#### DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- **Purpose**: Intentionally vulnerable application for testing your security controls
- **Container Deployment**: Runs in Docker for easy management and isolation
- **Learning Value**: Provides realistic attack scenarios to test your SOC

### 4. **Monitoring and Detection**

#### Wazuh Agent (Host-Based Monitoring)
- **Deployment**: Installed on each EC2 instance you want to monitor
- **Function**: Monitors system logs, file changes, and suspicious activities
- **Learning Value**: Understand endpoint detection and response (EDR) concepts

#### Wazuh Manager + SIEM
- **Central Hub**: Collects and analyzes logs from all Wazuh agents
- **SIEM Capabilities**: Correlates events, generates alerts, provides dashboards
- **Learning Value**: Experience with centralized security monitoring

### 5. **AWS Cloud Security Integration**

#### CloudTrail
- **Purpose**: Logs all API calls and management actions in your AWS account
- **Learning Value**: Understand cloud audit logging and account monitoring
- **Integration**: Feeds logs into your SIEM for correlation with other events

#### GuardDuty
- **Purpose**: AWS-native threat detection service
- **Function**: Analyzes CloudTrail, DNS logs, and VPC flow logs for threats
- **Learning Value**: Experience with cloud-native security services

### 6. **Automation and Response**

#### AWS Lambda Functions
- **Purpose**: Automated response to security events
- **Examples**: Blocking malicious IPs, creating incident tickets, sending notifications
- **Learning Value**: Understand security orchestration and automated response

#### External Integrations
- **VirusTotal**: Threat intelligence for file and IP reputation
- **JIRA/GitHub**: Incident ticketing and tracking
- **SNS**: Notification system for alerts

## üåê Optional AWS Networking Components

### When You Might Need These (Advanced Learning)

#### Internet Gateway
- **Current Usage**: Already included in this architecture
- **Purpose**: Provides internet access to your public subnet
- **Learning Point**: Essential for any internet-facing AWS resources

#### NAT Gateway (Optional Enhancement)
- **Use Case**: If your private subnet resources need outbound internet access
- **Example**: Wazuh agents downloading updates, Lambda functions calling external APIs
- **Cost Consideration**: NAT Gateway has hourly charges - consider NAT Instance for learning

#### Transit Gateway (Advanced Scenario)
- **Use Case**: When connecting multiple VPCs or on-premises networks
- **Learning Scenario**: If you want to simulate a multi-environment SOC
- **Example**: Separate VPCs for development, staging, and production monitoring

#### VPC Endpoints (Cost Optimization)
- **Use Case**: Access AWS services without internet routing
- **Example**: S3 VPC Endpoint for CloudTrail logs, reducing NAT Gateway costs
- **Learning Value**: Understand private connectivity to AWS services

## üß† Final Thoughts

This architecture is a **learning sandbox**, not a security standard. It's designed to help you understand how SOC components work together, how security events flow through different systems, and how automated responses can improve incident handling.

**Remember**: Real-world SOCs are much more complex, with dedicated teams, enterprise tools, and strict procedures. This prototype gives you a foundation to understand those concepts before moving to production environments.

**Start small, learn continuously, and always prioritize understanding over complexity.** The goal is to build your security knowledge and practical skills in a cost-effective, hands-on way.
